**NEXA: Building the Future of Remote Interaction ðŸ¤–**

A project for my integrated M.Tech in AI at VIT Bhopal University. NEXA is more than just another messaging app. It's an exploration into creating a truly seamless platform for digital communication, addressing the limitations of existing services like WhatsApp and Telegram. Leveraging advanced features and a user-centric design, NEXA is built to connect people in a way that feels natural and intuitive, all without ever needing to meet in person. Dive into the code and help us build this new era of connection!
